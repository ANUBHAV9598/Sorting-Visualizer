Overview

A Sorting Visualizer is an educational web application designed to demonstrate the inner workings of various sorting algorithms.
This tool helps users visualize the step-by-step process each algorithm follows to sort a collection of data. By providing a visual representation,
it makes it easier to grasp the concept and mechanics of sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Selection Sort, and more.

Sorting Algorithms

Bubble Sort:

Theory: Bubble Sort repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.

Complexity: O(n^2) in the worst and average case.

Insertion Sort:

Theory: Insertion Sort builds the sorted array one item at a time, picking the next item and inserting it into its correct position.

Complexity: O(n^2) in the worst case but efficient for small data sets.

Merge Sort:

Theory: Merge Sort divides the array into halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves back together.

Complexity: O(n log n) in all cases.

Selection Sort:

Theory: Selection Sort divides the list into two parts: the sorted part at the beginning and the unsorted part.
It repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted part and moves it to the sorted part.

Complexity: O(n^2) in the worst and average case.
